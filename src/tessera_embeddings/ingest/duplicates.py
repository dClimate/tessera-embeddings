"""Choosing between duplicate catalogue items for one tile and one solar day.

Element 84's Sentinel-2 catalogue holds **more than one item per tile-date** whenever a
granule has been reprocessed: same tile, same acquisition, different processing baseline,
distinguished by ``s2:sequence``. This is common rather than exceptional — a single MGRS
tile can have dozens of duplicated dates in a single season.

Two things make that a problem rather than a curiosity.

**The loader fuses them.** ``odc.stac.load`` groups by solar day and mosaics every item in
the group, so both copies are read and one unreadable copy fails the whole date. Choosing
one copy up front is what makes a fallback possible at all: while both are in the group
there is nothing to fall back *to*.

**Their baselines differ, and the correction is keyed by date.** One copy can sit either
side of the reflectance-offset threshold from the other, so a fused date can hold pixels
processed both ways while exactly one correction is applied to the result — decided by item
order rather than by which copy supplied the pixels.

The preference is **newest first**, which is the newer reprocessing and the better data in
the overwhelming majority of cases. Corruption in a newer copy is rare: sampling duplicate
pairs chosen independently of failure found every copy intact. It is also not a property of
being newer — so the older copy is a *fallback*, never a default. Callers step down the
alternates only on a demonstrated read failure.
