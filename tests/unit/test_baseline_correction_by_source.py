"""Whether the BOA offset is corrected is a per-ITEM question, not a per-collection one.

ESA changed processing baseline 04.00 in January 2022: from that baseline on, surface
reflectance carries a +1000 offset that has to be subtracted. Element 84 harmonises its own
COGs — it subtracts it for you — so the Earth Search collection config used to leave
`baseline_threshold` unset with a comment saying no correction was needed.

That stopped being true when the same collection began indexing items whose assets point at
ESA's originals, which carry the offset. Reading the collection alone exempts, or corrects,
both kinds together, and one of those is always wrong. Nothing raises either way.

The threshold is therefore set, and the exemption is decided per item from where its assets
live. These tests pin both directions, because each is a silent corruption in its own
direction: a skipped correction leaves plausible pixels 1000 too high, a doubled one shifts
every value by 1000.
